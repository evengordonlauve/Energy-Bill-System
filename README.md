# Energy-Bill-System

This repository now provides a very small Next.js skeleton. The application only renders an "Under Construction" page.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies (requires network access):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the placeholder page.
